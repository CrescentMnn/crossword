# crossword puzzle

This project's primary goal was to create a dynamic crossword puzzle application that made use of topics i learned in my Operating Systems course, such as mutex, processes, signals, and
threads. The project's objective was to give players a demanding and engaging gaming experience while showcasing their ability to apply course principles to real-world problem-solving.
