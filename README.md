## crossword puzzle

This project's primary goal was to create a dynamic crossword puzzle application that made use of topics i learned in my Operating Systems course, such as mutex, processes, signals, and
threads. The project's objective was to give players a demanding and engaging gaming experience while showcasing their ability to apply course principles to real-world problem-solving.

The project consists of:

    • There must be a minimum of three vertical and three horizontal words in the
    crossword puzzle.
    • Every word must cross paths with a minimum of one other word.
    • After a specific period of time, the entire board will change:
    • The word intersections are saved.

## Processes and Thread layout
